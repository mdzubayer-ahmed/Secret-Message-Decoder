This Python code decodes a secret message encoded using an XOR cipher by trying different cipher values and selecting the one that produces a decrypted message with valid ASCII characters. <br/>

Here's is a simple explanation:

* split_32bit_to_8bit(number): This function takes a 32-bit integer number, converts it to its binary representation, and splits it into four 8-bit binary numbers. It returns these four 8-bit binary numbers as a list.

* xor_8bit_binary(bin_str1, bin_str2): This function takes two 8-bit binary numbers represented as strings, performs a bitwise XOR operation on them, and then converts the resulting binary number back to its integer representation. It returns this integer value.

* find_cipher(number): This function is used to find the cipher value by trying to decode the given number using all possible cipher codes (values from 0 to 255). It iterates through each possible cipher code, decrypts the message using XOR, and checks if the resulting characters fall within the range of ASCII characters from 'A' to 'z'. If the decrypted message has a length of 4 characters and contains only valid ASCII characters, it prints the cipher value and the decrypted message.

* main(): This is the main function where the script starts its execution. It initializes a list of numbers representing the encrypted message, calls find_cipher() to find the most likely cipher value, and then decrypts the entire message using this cipher. Finally, it prints out the decrypted secret message and the cipher value used.
